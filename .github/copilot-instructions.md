## General
- I like to be addressed personally, so call me Bart when answering my questions.

## Coding Style
-   Use spaces for indentation with four-spaces per level, unless it is a csproj file, then use two-spaces per level.
-   All public members require doc comments.
-   Prefer type declarations over `var` when the type isn't obvious.
